Welcome to the Math Exam Assistant, a Python program designed to help you practice simle arithmetic calculations in a fun and interactive way! Whether you're a student looking to sharpen your math skills or simply curious about testing your mental math abilities, this program is here to make learning enjoyable.

I created this application with the intention of providing my children with a more engaging and efficient way to practice arithmetic problems. The constant task of manually writing out arithmetic exercises on paper had become quite tiresome. Moreover, I firmly believe that introducing a console-based application to the realm of education carries significant advantages.
## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** With a clear console screen and simple prompts, the Math Exam Assistant ensures a seamless experience.

- **Immediate Feedback:** Receive instant feedback on your answers – the program lets you know whether you're correct or need to make adjustments.

- **Error Correction:** Not to worry if you make mistakes! The program offers a chance to correct errors and learn from them.
